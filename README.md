# Machine Learning Algorithms
ML based algorithms for Recommendation Systems, Clustering, Classification, Dimensionality Reduction, etc.,

This repository contains multiple algorithms with possible application level implementations.
The alogorithms are implemented in Python using NumPy and Pandas.

## What is the aim?
The aim is gain deep understanding and knowledge of ML concepts. And, to see the practicality of the learning that's acquired.

## Do you want to contribute?
Your contributions are always welcome! Feel free to improve existing code, documentation or implement new algorithm.
If there are big changes, kindly open an issue to propose them.
