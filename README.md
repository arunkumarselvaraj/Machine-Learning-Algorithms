# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
ML based algorithms for Recommendation Systems, Clustering, Classification, Dimensionality Reduction, etc.,

This repository contains multiple algorithms with possible application level implementations that is targetted to see the practicality of the learning and knowledge that's acquired.

## How to run the code?
python CF_Recommendation.py
You can also modify the last line of the file, CF_Recommendation.py. The test data is hard coded. Soon, it will be modified to support dynamic data.

## Do you want to contribute?
Your contributions are always welcome! Feel free to improve existing code, documentation or implement new algorithm.
If there are big changes, kindly open an issue to propose your changes.
